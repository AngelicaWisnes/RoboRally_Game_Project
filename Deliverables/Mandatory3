**PART 1**

* How do the roles of the team work? 

* Are there any experiences either team-wise or regarding project methodology that is worth mentioning?

* How are the group dynamics?

* How does communication work for you?

* Retrospective: 

* During evaluation, every member's contribution to the code base will be emphasized. If there is a big
difference in who commits, you must enclose a brief explanation as to why it is like that. Remember to
commit everything. Including design files.

* Report from meetings since the previous delivery must also be delivered.

* Set up 4-5 points to follow up.

**PART 2**

* Clarification of the customer's requirements. What are the actual tasks?

* How do the team Prioritize these tasks?

* If changes are made in order from what is given by the customer, why is this done?

* How will you verify that the requirements are met? (What are the acceptance criteria?)

* Update what your priorities are, how far you have come and what you have done since last time.

* The list of requirements is long, but it is not necessary to deliver on all requirements if it is not realistic. It is
more important that the tasks that you've executed are of high quality. Regard subproblem 4: "Completed
tasks must be finished."

**PART 3**

* You need to document how the project builds, tests, and runs such that it's easy to test the code. During
evaluation, the code will also be user tested.

* Document how the tests should be run, as well.

* Code quality and test coverage are emphasized. Note that the tests you write must be used in the
product.

* Completed tasks must be finished.

* Deliver class diagrams. (If there are many classes, make class diagrams for the most important ones.)
