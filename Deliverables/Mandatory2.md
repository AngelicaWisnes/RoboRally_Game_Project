**PART 2**

Spesifications:
* A brief description of the overall goal of the application. 
  * Construct a functional game based on the boardgame RoboRally
* A list of requirements for the system based on the high level requirements reviewed in lecture. 
  * LIST OF REQUIREMENTS:
* A priority list of which requirements you want to include in the first iteration (ie until delivery of this assignment).
  * Look further down

First code part
“ A couple of good "first steps" are to show a two-dimensional game board, and place a piece on the board.”
1. Show the board
   1. Board-class
   1. BoardGUI 
1. Place a tile on the board
   1. Tile-class
   1. A TileGUI that holds the tiles?
1. Construct the cards
   1. Card-class


**PART 3**

* Meetings, and frequency of meetings: 
  * 1-2 times a week
* Communication between: 
  * Facebook, slack
* Labour distribution 
  * Distribute the work in the project board in github
* Follow-up work:
  * Review in github project board
* Sharing and storing common documents, charts and the codebase
  * Plan what to do in the meetings, write it down in google docs and github project board

**SUMMARY**

Repo:
* What went well:
  * The teamwork and planning
  * Getting the project going and having a program that works as anticipated
* What didn’t work as expected:
  * We had some problem with getting the program to run on all of our computers because of a problem with the mvn-app.iml file. We solved the problem by adding the file to .gitignore. 
* New activities or tools for next exercise:
  * Create the card-class

How we did: 

We made a good plan for the week and we followed that plan and made a working board with different tiles and a moving piece on it. The only thing we weren't able to do from out project board was to make a card-class. 
We know from our repo that we'll plan minimum working hours for working with the project outside our meetings(for each week). And we have know how much work to set up on the project board so all of it is completed in the end of the sprint.
